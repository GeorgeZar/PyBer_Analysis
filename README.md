# PyBer_Analysis
Here, we analyse ridesharing datasets using the pandas programming language. For rural, suburban, and urban cities, use City Data of format city,driver count,type and Ride Data of format city,date,fare,ride id to determine the following:
•	Total Rides
•	Total Drivers
•	Total Fares
•	Average Fare per Ride
•	Average Fare per Driver


Summary:
This analysis shows that urban cities have higher rideshare activity producing a greater proportion of total fares relative to suburban and rural cities.

Recommendations Based on City Differences:
We see in Pyber Summary Dataframe that fares generated in urban cities account for 63% of the total fares in our data, indicating it is this environment in which rideshare companies are most likely to find success. This is also shown from the significantly higher number of drivers in urban cities relative to other types. It is therefore advised to focus resources primarily in urban settings. We also find from Plot of Total Fare by City Type that late February to early March provide the highest total fares for each city type, suggesting this may be an ideal time to increase the number of drivers to accommodate this increased demand. Finally, we note that the month of March provides particularly low fares in suburban and rural cities. It therefore may be wise to move resources from these types of cities to urban ones at this time to counter this decline.


Results:
We see from the Pyber Summary Dataframe that there are significant differences in ride cost and activity between the rural, suburban, and urban cities.

Total Rides
Breakdown of the total number of rides by city type:
•	Rural: 125
•	Suburban: 625
•	Urban: 1,625
The number of rides in urban cities is 13 times that of rural cities, which likely follows from a population difference of similar magnitude


Total Drivers
Breakdown of the total number of drivers by city type:
•	Rural: 78
•	Suburban: 490
•	Urban: 2,405


Total Fares
Breakdown of the total fare cost by city type:
•	Rural: $4,327.93
•	Suburban: $19,356.33
•	Urban: $39,854.38
We find that urban cities provide approximately 63% of the total fares in this data. This roughly follows from January 2019 through April 2019 as shown in Plot of Total Fare by City Type.


Average Fare per Ride
Breakdown of the average fare per ride by city type:
•	Rural: $34.62
•	Suburban: $30.97
•	Urban: $24.53
We see that while there are fewer rides in rural cities, the average fare per ride is greater than that of urban cities by a factor of roughly 1.4.
